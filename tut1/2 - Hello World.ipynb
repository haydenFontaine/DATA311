    "This section discusses the creation of your first program, running the\n",
    "interpreter, and some basic debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programs always run inside an interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter is a \"console-based\" application that normally runs\n",
    "from a command shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3\n",
    "Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5050, Mar 21 2017, 01:21:04)\n",
    "[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Expert programmers usually have no problem using the interpreter in\n",
    "this way, but it's not so user-friendly for beginners.  You may be using\n",
    "an environment that provides a different interface to Python.  That's fine,\n",
    "but learning how to run Python terminal is still a useful skill to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start Python, you get an *interactive* mode where you can experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you start typing statements, they will run immediately. There is no\n",
    "edit/compile/run/debug cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print('hello world')\n",
    "hello world\n",
    ">>> 37*42\n",
    "1554\n",
    ">>> for i in range(5):\n",
    "...     print(i)\n",
    "...\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This so-called *read-eval-print-loop* (or REPL) is very useful for debugging and exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STOP**: If you can't figure out how to interact with Python, stop what you're doing\n",
    "and figure out how to do it.  If you're using an IDE, it might be hidden behind a\n",
    "menu option or other window.  Many parts of this course assume that you can\n",
    "interact with the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at the elements of the REPL:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `>>>` is the interpreter prompt for starting a new statement.\n",
    "- `...` is the interpreter prompt for continuing a statement. Enter a blank line to finish typing and run what you've entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `...` prompt may or may not be shown depending on your environment. For this course,\n",
    "it is shown as blanks to make it easier to cut/paste code samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underscore `_` holds the last result.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 37 * 42\n",
    "1554\n",
    ">>> _ * 2\n",
    "3108\n",
    ">>> _ + 50\n",
    "3158\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is only true in the interactive mode.* You never use `_` in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are put in `.py` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# hello.py\n",
    "print('hello world')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create these files with your favorite text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute a program, run it in the terminal with the `python` command.\n",
    "For example, in command-line Unix:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bash % python hello.py\n",
    "hello world\n",
    "bash %\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or from the Windows shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\SomeFolder>hello.py\n",
    "hello world\n",
    "\n",
    "C:\\SomeFolder>c:\\python36\\python hello.py\n",
    "hello world\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: On Windows, you may need to specify a full path to the Python interpreter such as `c:\\python36\\python`.\n",
    "However, if Python is installed in its usual way, you might be able to just type the name of the program\n",
    "such as `hello.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Sample Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's solve the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> One morning, you go out and place a dollar bill on the sidewalk by the Sears tower in Chicago.\n",
    "> Each day thereafter, you go out double the number of bills.\n",
    "> How long does it take for the stack of bills to exceed the height of the tower?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# sears.py\n",
    "bill_thickness = 0.11 * 0.001 # Meters (0.11 mm)\n",
    "sears_height = 442 # Height (meters)\n",
    "num_bills = 1\n",
    "day = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while num_bills * bill_thickness < sears_height:\n",
    "    print(day, num_bills, num_bills * bill_thickness)\n",
    "    day = day + 1\n",
    "    num_bills = num_bills * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "print('Number of days', day)\n",
    "print('Number of bills', num_bills)\n",
    "print('Final height', num_bills * bill_thickness)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run it, you get the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bash % python3 sears.py\n",
    "1 1 0.00011\n",
    "2 2 0.00022\n",
    "3 4 0.00044\n",
    "4 8 0.00088\n",
    "5 16 0.00176\n",
    "6 32 0.00352\n",
    "...\n",
    "21 1048576 115.34336\n",
    "22 2097152 230.68672\n",
    "Number of days 23 \n",
    "Number of bills 4194304 \n",
    "Final height 461.37344\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this program as a guide, you can learn a number of important core concepts about Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A python program is a sequence of statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 3 + 4\n",
    "b = a * 2\n",
    "print(b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each statement is terminated by a newline. Statements are executed one after the other until control reaches the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are text that will not be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 3 + 4\n",
    "# This is a comment\n",
    "b = a * 2\n",
    "print(b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are denoted by `#` and extend to the end of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a name for a value. You can use letters (lower and\n",
    "upper-case) from a to z. As well as the character underscore `_`.\n",
    "Numbers can also be part of the name of a variable, except as the\n",
    "first character.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "height = 442 # valid\n",
    "_height = 442 # valid\n",
    "height2 = 442 # valid\n",
    "2height = 442 # invalid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables do not need to be declared with the type of the value.  The type\n",
    "is associated with the value on the right hand side, not name of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "height = 442           # An integer\n",
    "height = 442.0         # Floating point\n",
    "height = 'Really tall' # A string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed. The perceived \"type\" of a variable might change\n",
    "as a program executes depending on the current value assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case Sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is case sensitive. Upper and lower-case letters are considered different letters.\n",
    "These are all different variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = 'Jake'\n",
    "Name = 'Elwood'\n",
    "NAME = 'Guido'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Language statements are always lower-case.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while x < 0:   # OK\n",
    "WHILE x < 0:   # ERROR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looping\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` statement executes a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while num_bills * bill_thickness < sears_height:\n",
    "    print(day, num_bills, num_bills * bill_thickness)\n",
    "    day = day + 1\n",
    "    num_bills = num_bills * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "print('Number of days', day)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The statements indented below the `while` will execute as long as the expression after the `while` is `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation is used to denote groups of statements that go together.\n",
    "Consider the previous example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while num_bills * bill_thickness < sears_height:\n",
    "    print(day, num_bills, num_bills * bill_thickness)\n",
    "    day = day + 1\n",
    "    num_bills = num_bills * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "print('Number of days', day)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation groups the following statements together as the operations that repeat:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(day, num_bills, num_bills * bill_thickness)\n",
    "    day = day + 1\n",
    "    num_bills = num_bills * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the `print()` statement at the end is not indented, it\n",
    "does not belong to the loop. The empty line is just for\n",
    "readability. It does not affect the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use spaces instead of tabs.\n",
    "* Use 4 spaces per level.\n",
    "* Use a Python-aware editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's only requirement is that indentation within the same block\n",
    "be consistent.   For example, this is an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while num_bills * bill_thickness < sears_height:\n",
    "    print(day, num_bills, num_bills * bill_thickness)\n",
    "        day = day + 1 # ERROR\n",
    "    num_bills = num_bills * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement is used to execute a conditional:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if a > b:\n",
    "    print('Computer says no')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Computer says yes')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check for multiple conditions by adding extra checks using `elif`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if a > b:\n",
    "    print('Computer says no')\n",
    "elif a == b:\n",
    "    print('Computer says yes')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Computer says maybe')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Printing\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print` function produces a single line of text with the values passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello world!') # Prints the text 'Hello world!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use variables. The text printed will be the value of the variable, not the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 100\n",
    "print(x) # Prints the text '100'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pass more than one value to `print` they are separated by spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = 'Jake'\n",
    "print('My name is', name) # Print the text 'My name is Jake'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`print()` always puts a newline at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello')\n",
    "print('My name is', 'Jake')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This prints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "Hello\n",
    "My name is Jake\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The extra newline can be suppressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello', end=' ')\n",
    "print('My name is', 'Jake')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will now print:\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "Hello My name is Jake\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### User input\n",
    "\n",
    "To read a line of typed user input, use the `input()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = input('Enter your name:')\n",
    "print('Your name is', name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`input` prints a prompt to the user and returns their response.\n",
    "This is useful for small programs, learning exercises or simple debugging.\n",
    "It is not widely used for real programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### pass statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to specify an empty code block. The keyword `pass` is used for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if a > b:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Computer says false')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also called a \"no-op\" statement. It does nothing. It serves as a placeholder for statements, possibly to be added later."
