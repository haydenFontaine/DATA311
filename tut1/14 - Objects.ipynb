    "# Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces more details about Python's internal object model and\n",
    "discusses some matters related to memory management, copying, and type checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Many operations in Python are related to *assigning* or *storing* values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = value         # Assignment to a variable\n",
    "s[n] = value      # Assignment to a list\n",
    "s.append(value)   # Appending to a list\n",
    "d['key'] = value  # Adding to a dictionary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*A caution: assignment operations **never make a copy** of the value being assigned.*\n",
    "All assignments are merely reference copies (or pointer copies if you prefer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this code fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1,2,3]\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "c = [a,b]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A picture of the underlying memory operations. In this example, there\n",
    "is only one list object `[1,2,3]`, but there are four different\n",
    "references to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "![References](references.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that modifying a value affects *all* references.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a.append(999)\n",
    ">>> a\n",
    "[1,2,3,999]\n",
    ">>> b\n",
    "[1,2,3,999]\n",
    ">>> c\n",
    "[[1,2,3,999], [1,2,3,999]]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how a change in the original list shows up everywhere else\n",
    "(yikes!).  This is because no copies were ever made. Everything is\n",
    "pointing to the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reassigning values\n",
    "\n",
    "Reassigning a value *never* overwrites the memory used by the previous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1,2,3]\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "a = [4,5,6]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(a)      # [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "print(b)      # [1, 2, 3]    Holds the original value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: **Variables are names, not memory locations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Dangers\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know about this sharing, you will shoot yourself in the\n",
    "foot at some point.  Typical scenario. You modify some data thinking\n",
    "that it's your own private copy and it accidentally corrupts some data\n",
    "in some other part of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Comment: This is one of the reasons why the primitive datatypes (int,\n",
    " float, string) are immutable (read-only).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identity and References\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `is` operator to check if two values are exactly the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = [1,2,3]\n",
    ">>> b = a\n",
    ">>> a is b\n",
    "True\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`is` compares the object identity (an integer).  The identity can be\n",
    "obtained using `id()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> id(a)\n",
    "3588944\n",
    ">>> id(b)\n",
    "3588944\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is almost always better to use `==` for checking objects.  The behavior\n",
    "of `is` is often unexpected:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = [1,2,3]\n",
    ">>> b = a\n",
    ">>> c = [1,2,3]\n",
    ">>> a is b\n",
    "True\n",
    ">>> a is c\n",
    "False\n",
    ">>> a == c\n",
    "True\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shallow copies\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and dicts have methods for copying.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = [2,3,[100,101],4]\n",
    ">>> b = list(a) # Make a copy\n",
    ">>> a is b\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a new list, but the list items are shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a[2].append(102)\n",
    ">>> b[2]\n",
    "[100,101,102]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    ">>> a[2] is b[2]\n",
    "True\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the inner list `[100, 101, 102]` is being shared.\n",
    "This is known as a shallow copy.  Here is a picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Shallow copy](shallow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep copies\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to make a copy of an object and all the objects contained within it.\n",
    "You can use the `copy` module for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = [2,3,[100,101],4]\n",
    ">>> import copy\n",
    ">>> b = copy.deepcopy(a)\n",
    ">>> a[2].append(102)\n",
    ">>> b[2]\n",
    "[100,101]\n",
    ">>> a[2] is b[2]\n",
    "False\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Names, Values, Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names do not have a *type*. It's only a name.\n",
    "However, values *do* have an underlying type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = 42\n",
    ">>> b = 'Hello World'\n",
    ">>> type(a)\n",
    "<type 'int'>\n",
    ">>> type(b)\n",
    "<type 'str'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`type()` will tell you what it is. The type name is usually used as a function\n",
    "that creates or converts a value to that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "How to tell if an object is a specific type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if isinstance(a, list):\n",
    "    print('a is a list')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking for one of many possible types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if isinstance(a, (list,tuple)):\n",
    "    print('a is a list or tuple')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Caution: Don't go overboard with type checking. It can lead to\n",
    "excessive code complexity.  Usually you'd only do it if doing\n",
    "so would prevent common mistakes made by others using your code.\n",
    "*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Everything is an object\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers, strings, lists, functions, exceptions, classes, instances,\n",
    "etc. are all objects.  It means that all objects that can be named can\n",
    "be passed around as data, placed in containers, etc., without any\n",
    "restrictions.  There are no *special* kinds of objects.  Sometimes it\n",
    "is said that all objects are \"first-class\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import math\n",
    ">>> items = [abs, math, ValueError ]\n",
    ">>> items\n",
    "[<built-in function abs>,\n",
    "  <module 'math' (builtin)>,\n",
    "  <type 'exceptions.ValueError'>]\n",
    ">>> items[0](-45)\n",
    "45\n",
    ">>> items[1].sqrt(2)\n",
    "1.4142135623730951\n",
    ">>> try:\n",
    "        x = int('not a number')\n",
    "    except items[2]:\n",
    "        print('Failed!')\n",
    "Failed!\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `items` is a list containing a function, a module and an\n",
    "exception.  You can directly use the items in the list in place of the\n",
    "original names:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items[0](-45)       # abs\n",
    "items[1].sqrt(2)    # math\n",
    "except items[2]:    # ValueError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of exercises, we look at some of the power that comes from first-class\n",
    "objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 7.1: First-class Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the file `Data/portfolio.csv`, we read data organized as columns that look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "name,shares,price\n",
    "\"AA\",100,32.20\n",
    "\"IBM\",50,91.10\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous code, we used the `csv` module to read the file, but still\n",
    "had to perform manual type conversions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for row in rows:\n",
    "    name   = row[0]\n",
    "    shares = int(row[1])\n",
    "    price  = float(row[2])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of conversion can also be performed in a more clever manner\n",
    "using some list basic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a Python list that contains the names of the conversion functions\n",
    "you would use to convert each column into the appropriate type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> types = [str, int, float]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason you can even create this list is that everything in Python\n",
    "is *first-class*.  So, if you want to have a list of functions, that’s\n",
    "fine.  The items in the list you created are functions for converting\n",
    "a value `x` into a given type (e.g., `str(x)`, `int(x)`, `float(x)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, read a row of data from the above file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import csv\n",
    ">>> f = open('Data/portfolio.csv')\n",
    ">>> rows = csv.reader(f)\n",
    ">>> headers = next(rows)\n",
    ">>> row = next(rows)\n",
    ">>> row\n",
    "['AA', '100', '32.20']\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, this row isn’t enough to do calculations because the types\n",
    "are wrong. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> row[1] * row[2]\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, maybe the data can be paired up with the types you specified\n",
    "in `types`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> types[1]\n",
    "<type 'int'>\n",
    ">>> row[1]\n",
    "'100'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try converting one of the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> types[1](row[1])     # Same as int(row[1])\n",
    "100\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try converting a different value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> types[2](row[2])     # Same as float(row[2])\n",
    "32.2\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try the calculation with converted values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> types[1](row[1])*types[2](row[2])\n",
    "3220.0000000000005\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Zip the column types with the fields and look at the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> r = list(zip(types, row))\n",
    ">>> r\n",
    "[(<type 'str'>, 'AA'), (<type 'int'>, '100'), (<type 'float'>,'32.20')]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that this has paired a type conversion with a\n",
    "value. For example, `int` is paired with the value `'100'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zipped list is useful if you want to perform conversions on all of\n",
    "the values, one after the other. Try this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> converted = []\n",
    ">>> for func, val in zip(types, row):\n",
    "          converted.append(func(val))\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> converted\n",
    "['AA', 100, 32.2]\n",
    ">>> converted[1] * converted[2]\n",
    "3220.0000000000005\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you understand what’s happening in the above code.  In the\n",
    "loop, the `func` variable is one of the type conversion functions\n",
    "(e.g., `str`, `int`, etc.) and the `val` variable is one of the values\n",
    "like `'AA'`, `'100'`.  The expression `func(val)` is converting a\n",
    "value (kind of like a type cast).\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code can be compressed into a single list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> converted = [func(val) for func, val in zip(types, row)]\n",
