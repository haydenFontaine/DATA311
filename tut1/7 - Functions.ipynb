    "# 1.7 Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As your programs start to get larger, you'll want to get organized.  This section\n",
    "briefly introduces functions and library modules.  Error handling with exceptions is also introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use functions for code you want to reuse. Here is a function definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sumcount(n):\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "    Returns the sum of the first n integers\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    while n > 0:\n",
    "        total += n\n",
    "        n -= 1\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To call a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = sumcount(100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a series of statements that perform some task and return a result.\n",
    "The `return` keyword is needed to explicitly specify the return value of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Library Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with a large standard library.\n",
    "Library modules are accessed using `import`.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "x = math.sqrt(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "import urllib.request\n",
    "u = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.python.org/')\n",
    "data = u.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover libraries and modules in more detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errors and exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions report errors as exceptions.  An exception causes a function to abort and may\n",
    "cause your entire program to stop if unhandled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try this in your python REPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> int('N/A')\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'N/A'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For debugging purposes, the message describes what happened, where the error occurred,\n",
    "and a traceback showing the other function calls that led to the failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Catching and Handling Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be caught and handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "To catch, use the `try - except` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for line in file:\n",
    "    fields = line.split(',')\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        shares = int(fields[1])\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Couldn't parse\", line)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name `ValueError` must match the kind of error you are trying to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often difficult to know exactly what kinds of errors might occur\n",
    "in advance depending on the operation being performed.  For better or\n",
    "for worse, exception handling often gets added *after* a program has\n",
    "unexpectedly crashed (i.e., \"oh, we forgot to catch that error. We\n",
    "should handle that!\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raising Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise an exception, use the `raise` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise RuntimeError('What a kerfuffle')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will cause the program to abort with an exception traceback. Unless caught by a `try-except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% python3 foo.py\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"foo.py\", line 21, in <module>\n",
    "    raise RuntimeError(\"What a kerfuffle\")\n",
    "RuntimeError: What a kerfuffle\n",

    "and turn it into a function `portfolio_cost(filename)`.  This\n",

    "the above output, you’ll notice that it has stripped the double-quotes\n",
    "away from the names in the first column.\n",
