    "# Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces ways to work with text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing Literal Text\n",
    "\n",
    "String literals are written in programs with quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Single quote\n",
    "a = 'Yeah but no but yeah but...'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Double quote\n",
    "b = \"computer says no\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Triple quotes\n",
    "c = '''\n",
    "Look into my eyes, look into my eyes, the eyes, the eyes, the eyes,\n",
    "not around the eyes,\n",
    "don't look around the eyes,\n",
    "look into my eyes, you're under.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally strings may only span a single line. Triple quotes capture all text enclosed across multiple lines\n",
    "including all formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no difference between using single (') versus double (\")\n",
    "quotes. *However, the same type of quote used to start a string must be used to\n",
    "terminate it*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### String escape codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Escape codes are used to represent control characters and characters that can't be easily typed\n",
    "directly at the keyboard.  Here are some common escape codes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "'\\n'      Line feed\n",
    "'\\r'      Carriage return\n",
    "'\\t'      Tab\n",
    "'\\''      Literal single quote\n",
    "'\\\"'      Literal double quote\n",
    "'\\\\'      Literal backslash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each character in a string is stored internally as a so-called Unicode \"code-point\" which is\n",
    "an integer.  You can specify an exact code-point value using the following escape sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = '\\xf1'          # a = 'ñ'\n",
    "b = '\\u2200'        # b = '∀'\n",
    "c = '\\U0001D122'    # c = '𝄢'\n",
    "d = '\\N{FOR ALL}'   # d = '∀'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Unicode Character Database](https://unicode.org/charts) is a reference for all\n",
    "available character codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings work like an array for accessing individual characters. You use an integer index, starting at 0.\n",
    "Negative indices specify a position relative to the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 'Hello world'\n",
    "b = a[0]          # 'H'\n",
    "c = a[4]          # 'o'\n",
    "d = a[-1]         # 'd' (end of string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also slice or select substrings specifying a range of indices with `:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = a[:5]     # 'Hello'\n",
    "e = a[6:]     # 'world'\n",
    "f = a[3:8]    # 'lo wo'\n",
    "g = a[-5:]    # 'world'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The character at the ending index is not included.  Missing indices assume the beginning or ending of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### String operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenation, length, membership and replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Concatenation (+)\n",
    "a = 'Hello' + 'World'   # 'HelloWorld'\n",
    "b = 'Say ' + a          # 'Say HelloWorld'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Length (len)\n",
    "s = 'Hello'\n",
    "len(s)                  # 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Membership test (`in`, `not in`)\n",
    "t = 'e' in s            # True\n",
    "f = 'x' in s            # False\n",
    "g = 'hi' not in s       # True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Replication (s * n)\n",
    "rep = s * 5             # 'HelloHelloHelloHelloHello'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### String methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings have methods that perform various operations with the string data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: stripping any leading / trailing white space.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = '  Hello '\n",
    "t = s.strip()     # 'Hello'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Case conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = 'Hello'\n",
    "l = s.lower()     # 'hello'\n",
    "u = s.upper()     # 'HELLO'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Replacing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = 'Hello world'\n",
    "t = s.replace('Hello' , 'Hallo')   # 'Hallo world'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**More string methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings have a wide variety of other methods for testing and manipulating the text data.\n",
    "This is a small sample of methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s.endswith(suffix)     # Check if string ends with suffix\n",
    "s.find(t)              # First occurrence of t in s\n",
    "s.index(t)             # First occurrence of t in s\n",
    "s.isalpha()            # Check if characters are alphabetic\n",
    "s.isdigit()            # Check if characters are numeric\n",
    "s.islower()            # Check if characters are lower-case\n",
    "s.isupper()            # Check if characters are upper-case\n",
    "s.join(slist)          # Join a list of strings using s as delimiter\n",
    "s.lower()              # Convert to lower case\n",
    "s.replace(old,new)     # Replace text\n",
    "s.rfind(t)             # Search for t from end of string\n",
    "s.rindex(t)            # Search for t from end of string\n",
    "s.split([delim])       # Split string into list of substrings\n",
    "s.startswith(prefix)   # Check if string starts with prefix\n",
    "s.strip()              # Strip leading/trailing space\n",
    "s.upper()              # Convert to upper case\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are \"immutable\" or read-only.\n",
    "Once created, the value can't be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> s = 'Hello World'\n",
    ">>> s[1] = 'a'\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**All operations and methods that manipulate string data, always create new strings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `str()` to convert any value to a string. The result is a string holding the\n",
    "same text that would have been produced by the `print()` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = 42\n",
    ">>> str(x)\n",
    "'42'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Byte Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "A string of 8-bit bytes, commonly encountered with low-level I/O, is written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = b'Hello World\\r\\n'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By putting a little b before the first quotation, you specify that it is a byte string as opposed to a text string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the usual string operations work.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "len(data)                         # 13\n",
    "data[0:5]                         # b'Hello'\n",
    "data.replace(b'Hello', b'Cruel')  # b'Cruel World\\r\\n'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing is a bit different because it returns byte values as integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data[0]   # 72 (ASCII code for 'H')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversion to/from text strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = data.decode('utf-8') # bytes -> text\n",
    "data = text.encode('utf-8') # text -> bytes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `'utf-8'` argument specifies a character encoding.  Other common\n",
    "values include `'ascii'` and `'latin1'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw strings are string literals with an uninterpreted backslash. They\n",
    "are specified by prefixing the initial quote with a lowercase \"r\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rs = r'c:\\newdata\\test' # Raw (uninterpreted backslash)\n",
    ">>> rs\n",
    "'c:\\\\newdata\\\\test'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The string is the literal text enclosed inside, exactly as typed.\n",
    "This is useful in situations where the backslash has special\n",
    "significance. Example: filename, regular expressions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### f-Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "A string with formatted expression substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> name = 'IBM'\n",
    ">>> shares = 100\n",
    ">>> price = 91.1\n",
    ">>> a = f'{name:>10s} {shares:10d} {price:10.2f}'\n",
    ">>> a\n",
    "'       IBM        100      91.10'\n",
    ">>> b = f'Cost = ${shares*price:0.2f}'\n",
    ">>> b\n",
    "'Cost = $9110.00'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: This requires Python 3.6 or newer.**  The meaning of the format codes\n",
    "is covered later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, you'll experiment with operations on Python's\n",
    "string type.  You should do this at the Python interactive prompt\n",
    "where you can easily see the results.  Important note:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In exercises where you are supposed to interact with the interpreter,\n",
    "> `>>>` is the interpreter prompt that you get when Python wants\n",
    "> you to type a new statement.  Some statements in the exercise span\n",
    "> multiple lines--to get these statements to run, you may have to hit\n",
    "> 'return' a few times.  Just a reminder that you *DO NOT* type\n",
    "> the `>>>` when working these examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by defining a string containing a series of stock ticker symbols like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
